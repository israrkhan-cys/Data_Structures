# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Repository  
**FAST-NUCES – 3rd Semester Coursework**

This repository contains a structured collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms** implementations, assignments, lab tasks, and practice resources created during my 3rd semester at FAST-NUCES.  
It is designed to serve as a **learning companion and reference guide** for students taking the DSA course.

Imp Material Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Da_v5uHIvBscWcRRgMsYGq-hJ00dQL9Y?usp=drive_link

This single Google Drive Coantians alot of learning materials  which will help you throught the course it has DSA Notes ,Practice Questions, Coding sheets etc. So must check this Out. 

**Pro Tip:** For exams, practice extensively from the "Most_IMP_Practice_ProblemSheet_for exams.xlsx" and solve as many problems as possible for each topic Most exam Questions come from this sheet.

### 📄 Comprehensive DSA Practice Questions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LHCLaDZfC5bwxBm7w0zuzViBERPfkd2-MI1FZKWUfVY/edit?usp=sharing
This document contains over 80 practice questions covering all major DSA topics.
Recommended approach: Whenever you study a new topic, go through and solve the related practice questions to reinforce your understanding.

## How to Use This Repository (Recommended)

1.Learn the concept first (lecture slides / book)
2.Explore relevant code in Codes_Written/
3.Practice from Practice_Problems/
4.Review Important_DSA_Problems.xlsx before exams and practice Questions for it for every topic and must solve past papers.
5.Modify code and re-implement it yourself

## Learning Tips

> **"Start early. Practice consistently. Build intuition."**
> 
- **Don't procrastinate** – DSA concepts build upon each other
- **Write code by hand** before typing it out
- **Explain concepts** to peers to reinforce your understanding
- **Solve problems daily** – consistency beats cramming
- **Use this repo as reference**, not just copy-paste material
