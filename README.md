# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Repository  
**FAST-NUCES – 3rd Semester Coursework**

This repository contains a structured collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms** implementations, assignments, lab tasks, and practice resources created during my 3rd semester at FAST-NUCES.  
It is designed to serve as a **learning companion and reference guide** for students taking the DSA course.

Imp Material Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Da_v5uHIvBscWcRRgMsYGq-hJ00dQL9Y?usp=drive_link
This single Google Drive Coantians alot of learning materials  which will help you throught the course it has DSA Notes ,Practice Questions, Coding sheets etc. So must check this Out. 

For Exams Must practice as much as you can from the excel sheet of different topics.

##  How to Use This Repository

### 📖 **Step 1: Learn the Concept**
- Review lecture slides or recommended textbooks
- Understand the theory before diving into code

### 🔍 **Step 2: Explore Implementations**
- Navigate to the relevant topic in the [`Codes_Written/`](./Codes_Written/) folder
- Study the code, trace through examples, and run them locally

### 💻 **Step 3: Practice Actively**
- Use problems in [`Practice_Problems/`](./Practice_Problems/) to test your understanding
- Try modifying or extending existing implementations
- Re-implement algorithms from scratch

### 📝 **Step 4: Revise for Exams**
- Refer to [`Most_IMP_Practice_ProblemSheet_for exams.xlsx`](./Most_IMP_Practice_ProblemSheet_for exams.xlsx) for curated problem lists 
- Solve past papers in [`Practice_Stuff/Past_Papers/`](./Practice_Stuff/Past_Papers/)

## Learning Tips

> **"Start early. Practice consistently. Build intuition."**
> 
- **Don't procrastinate** – DSA concepts build upon each other
- **Write code by hand** before typing it out
- **Explain concepts** to peers to reinforce your understanding
- **Solve problems daily** – consistency beats cramming
- **Use this repo as reference**, not just copy-paste material
